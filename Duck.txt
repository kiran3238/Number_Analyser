    In mathematics, a "duck number" is a term used 
    
    to describe a special type of number that has 
    
    a particular property when its digits are
    
    analyzed. A number is considered a duck number 
    
    if it contains at least one instance of the 
    
    digit zero (0), and when this digit is removed,
    
    the resulting number is not equal to zero. 
    
    In other words, a duck number is a positive 
    
    integer that has at least one zero in its 
    
    decimal representation, but removing that 
    
    zero leaves a nonzero integer.

    1024: Removing the zero gives 124, 
    which is not zero.

    207: Removing the zero gives 27, 
    which is not zero.

    30506: Removing any of the zeros 
    gives 356, which is not zero.
