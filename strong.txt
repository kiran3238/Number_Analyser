    A strong number (or strong integer) is a special type of number in mathematics.
    
    It is a number whose sum of the factorial of its digits is equal to the number itself.
    
    To determine if a number is a strong number, you need to follow these steps:
    1. Break the number into its individual digits.
    2. Compute the factorial of each digit.
    3. Add up the factorials of all the digits.
    4. Check if the sum is equal to the original number.
    
    For example, let's take the number 145:
    1. Break it into its digits: 1, 4, and 5.
    2. Compute the factorial of each digit: 1! = 1, 4! = 24, and 5! = 120.
    3. Add up the factorials: 1 + 24 + 120 = 145.
    4. Since the sum of the factorials (145) is equal to the original number (145),
    145 is a strong number.
    
    In contrast, if the sum of the factorials of the digits does not equal the original number,
    then it is not a strong number.
    Strong numbers are relatively rare and are primarily of mathematical interest. 
    They are sometimes called "strong integers" or "strong factorial numbers.
