    An Armstrong number (also known as a narcissistic number 

    or pluperfect digital invariant) is a number that is equal
                
    to the sum of its own digits each raised to the power of
        
    the number of digits. In other words, for a number with 
        
    n digits, if you take each digit, raise it to
        
    the power of n, and sum them up,
                
    you get the original number.

    Here's a simple example of an Armstrong number:

    153 is an Armstrong number because:

    It has 3 digits.
                
    The sum of the cubes of its digits is: 
            
    1^3 + 5^3 + 3^3 = 1 + 125 + 27 = 153.
                
    So, 153 is equal to the sum of its own digits 
        
    each raised to the power of 3.
