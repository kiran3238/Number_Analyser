            -------NUMBER ANALYZER-------

              ---PROJECT DESCRIPTION---
    
    The Number Analyzer project is a collaborative effort by four talented individuals:
    
    Yuvraj Bapusaheb Darekar , Prathamesh Nitin Sohoni, Kiran Vijaykumar Shende,
    
    and Saurabh Ramesh Borude. This project is designed to provide users with a   
    
    comprehensive tool for analyzing numbers from 1 to 100 based on various mathematical properties.

                     --FEATURES--

    With a simple click, you can highlight that specific numbers in the range (1-100).
    You'll also receive an explanation of numbers in the textbox.

    We've introduced a "CheckNumber" button that allows users to input a number.
    After entering a number and clicking this button,
    the project will determine which property the number belongs to (odd, even, prime,
    perfect, or Armstrong).
    The explanation will be displayed in the textbox.

                  WHY OUR PROJECT...?
    Our Number Analyzer project simplifies the process of understanding and identifying
    different types of numbers.
    It's not just a tool for mathematical analysis but also an educational resource for
    exploring the properties of numbers.
    Whether you're a student, a teacher, or simply someone curious about numbers,
    this project is designed to make number analysis accessible and fun.

            Thank you for using Number Analyzer!
