The Fibonacci series is a sequence of numbers where 
each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, 
usually starting with 0 and 1. In mathematical terms, 
it is defined by the recurrence relation:

F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2)

with the initial conditions:

F(0) = 0
F(1) = 1

So, the Fibonacci series begins with 0, 1
and then each subsequent number is the sum of the 
two numbers that precede it. Here are the first few
numbers in the Fibonacci series:

0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, ...
