    An automorphic number, also known as a circular 
    
    number or a permutational number, is a type of 
    
    integer in mathematics. An automorphic number 
    
    is defined as a number whose square (or some 
    
    other power) ends with the same digits as the
    
    number itself. In other words, an n-digit 
    
    number is considered automorphic if, when you
    
    square it and look at the last n digits of the 
    
    result, they are the same as the original number.

    5 is an automorphic number because 5^2 = 25, 
    and the last digit of 25 is 5.

    76 is an automorphic number because 76^2 = 5776, 
    and the last two digits of 5776 are 76.

    376 is an automorphic number because 376^2 = 141376,
    and the last three digits of 141376 are 376.
