    A composite number is a positive integer greater than 1

    that is not a prime number. In other words, a composite number

    has factors other than 1 and itself. It can be divided evenly

    by at least one positive integer other than 1 and itself.

    For example:

    4 is a composite number because it can be evenly divided by 1, 2, and 4.
    9 is a composite number because it can be evenly divided by 1, 3, and 9.
    15 is a composite number because it can be evenly divided by 1, 3, 5, and 15.
