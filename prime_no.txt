            A prime number is a positive integer greater than
                
            1 that has no positive integer divisors otherthan
                
            1 and itself. In other words, a prime number is a
                
            number that cannot be evenly divided by any other
                
            number except 1 and itself.

            Here's an example of a prime number:

            Example: 7

            The number 7 is a prime number because it can only
                
            be divided by 1 and 7 without leaving a remainder.
                
            It has no other divisors.
