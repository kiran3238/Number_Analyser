            
            A perfect number is a positive integer that
                
            is equal to the sum of its proper divisors,
                
            excluding itself. In other words, a perfect
                
            number is a number whose factors (excluding itself)
                
            add up to the number itself.
                
            Example: 28

            The divisors of 28 are 1, 2, 4, 7, and 14.
                
            The proper divisors of 28 are all divisors except
                
            28 itself, so the proper divisors of 28 are
             1, 2, 4, 7, and 14.
                
            We sum up the proper divisors: 1 + 2 + 4 + 7 + 14 = 28.
